            <h2>What is casual style of clothes?</h2>
            <p>Casual style is what you might wear on the weekend.</p>
            <p>
              Think jeans, comfortable T-shirts, and sneakers or flat boots.
              Both streetwear and sporty style might be considered types of
              casual styles, but casual style can also lean preppy or hip.

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
              In the 50s of the last century, a new Teddy-boys youth movement
              appeared in England. Simple guys-hooligans looked like students of
              prestigious schools. They wore draped jackets, pipe trousers and
              shirts with white collars. Teddy-boys were replaced in 1958 by
              "mods" (English modos), which somewhat resembled "tedds", but
              their style was more moderate and distinguished by minimalism. In
              the 60s, mods were replaced by new subcultures – aggressive punks
              and skinheads and pretentious hippies.

                The first store where this women's clothing was sold was called
                Hennes. It cannot be said that sales were high, but demand did
                not fall for 20 years.
